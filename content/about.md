title: "About me"

---
I grew up in a small paper mill town on the coast of Maine. When I was 16, one of the fossil fuel majors proposed opening a coal-fired power plant in my town. It was my first experience of big companies try to take advantage of small communities. My father took me along to local town council and planning board meetings, so I got to see first-hand how the proposed coal plant generated conflicts in the town and how the fight to prevent it was finally won.

I've built a career using data to better understand the impacts of environmental and climate problems on people and communities, especially those that are at risk of being ignored. After a couple decades in academia, I pivoted to work in civil society so that I could have more of a direct impact on the climate emergency. I'm always interested in opportunities that might allow me to do that more effectively.
