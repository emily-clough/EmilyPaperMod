title: "Critical Minerals and Social Conflict: Interactive Map and Data Dashboard"

## In numbers: Critical mineral production, ownership, and social unrest

I worked closely with a colleague develop this data dashboard and interactive map showing incidents of social unrest related to and in proximity to transition mineral mines. 

This project was delivered at pace. I coordinated relationships with public and private data providers, wireframed the project and hired an interactive developer, and ensured that the data was processed correctly before being fed into the dashboard and map.
